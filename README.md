# Banking and Polling Analysis

The Banking analysis is done by writing a basic Financial Analysis text document (PyBank_Results.txt) based on a profit loss CSV (budget_data.csv)

The Polling analysis is done by aggregating the election data (election_data.csv) and writing the pooling results to a text file (Pypoll_Results.txt)
